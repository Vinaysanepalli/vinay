        <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. <br>It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.<br> The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.<br>
            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.<br> The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million).<br> The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.<br>
            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. <br>It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history.<br> The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year.<br> In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
           <br> Resting in the middle of a wide plinth 23 feet (7 metres) high, the mausoleum proper is of white marble that reflects hues according to the intensity of sunlight or moonlight.<br> It has four nearly identical facades, each with a wide central arch rising to 108 feet (33 metres) at its apex and chamfered (slanted) corners incorporating smaller arches. <br>The majestic central dome, which reaches a height of 240 feet (73 metres) at the tip of its finial, is surrounded by four lesser domes.<br> The acoustics inside the main dome cause the single note of a flute to reverberate five times. <br>The interior of the mausoleum is organized around an octagonal marble chamber ornamented with low-relief carvings and semiprecious stones (pietra dura).<br> Therein are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahān.<br> Those false tombs are enclosed by a finely wrought filigree marble screen.<br> Beneath the tombs, at garden level, lie the true sarcophagi.<br> Standing gracefully apart from the central building, at each of the four corners of the square plinth, are elegant minarets.</p>

        <h2>Mysore Palace</h2>
        <p>The Palace of Mysore (also known as the Amba Vilas Palace) is a historical palace in the city of Mysore in Karnataka.<br> Designed by the English Architect, Henry Irwin, the Mysore Palace dominates the skyline of Mysore. <br>A three storied structure in the Indo-Saracenic style built between 1897-1912, the palace has beautifully designed square towers at cardinal points, covered with domes.<br> The Durbar Hall with its ornate ceiling and sculpted pillars and the Kalyanamantapa (marriage pavilion) with its glazed tiled flooring and stained glass, domed ceiling are worth noting.<br>Intricately carved doors, the golden howdah (elephant seat), paintings as well as the fabulous, jewel encrusted golden throne (displayed during Dasara) are amongst the palace’s other treasures.<br> The walled palace complex houses the Residential Museum (incorporating some of the Palace’s living quarters), temples and shrines including the Shwetha Varahaswamy temple. <br>The palace is illuminated on Sundays, Public Holidays as well as during the Dasara Celebrations where 97,000 electric bulbs are used to illuminate it.
            <br>Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace and Mysore Aramane, is one of the most magnificent and largest palaces in India.<br> Situated in the southern state of Karnataka, it used to be the official residence of the Wodeyar Dynasty, the rulers of Mysore from 1399 to 1950.<br> The grand palace stands tall in the heart of Mysore city and attracts visitors worldwide. <br>The Mysore Palace India has four entrances, the main entrance is called “Jaya Maarthaanda” to the East, “Jayarama” to the North, ”Balarama” to the South and “Varaha” to the West.<br> Being one of the prime attractions in India after the Taj Mahal, it certainly deserves a place on every traveller’s bucket list. </p>

        <h2>India Gate</h2>
        <p>At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle of a crossroad.<br> Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I.<br> The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919.<br> The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin Lutyens.<br> The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin.<br> Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence.<br> The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.<br> The entire arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. <br>The cornice is inscribed with the Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the dates MCMXIV (1914 left) and MCMXIX (1919 right). <br>The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries but this is rarely done.
            During nightfall, India Gate is dramatically floodlit while the fountains nearby make a lovely display with coloured lights.<br> India Gate stands at one end of Rajpath, and the area surrounding it is generally referred to as 'India Gate'.<br>Surrounding the imposing structure is a large expanse of lush green lawns, which is a popular picnic spot. One can see hoards of people moving about the brightly lit area and on the lawns on summer evenings.</p>
